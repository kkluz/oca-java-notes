## Chapter4: Operators
**Java operators** produce new values from one or more operands. The result of most operations is either a boolean or numeric value.   
**Operands** are the things on the right or left side of the operator. 
Java operators aren't typically overloaded. There are, however, a few exceptional operators that come overloaded:  
The + operator can be used to add two numeric primitives together or to  perform a concatenation operation if either operand is a String.
The &, |, and ^ operators can all be used in two different ways, although on this version of the exam, their bit-twiddling capabilities won't be tested.
